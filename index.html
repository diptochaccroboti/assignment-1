    <h2 align="center">PASTICHE</h2>
    <p align="center">
      Writing of Lamennais, Renan says: “Il créa avec des réminiscences de la
      Bible et du langage ecclésiastique cette manière harmonieuse et grandiose
      qui réalise le phénomène unique dans l’histoire littéraire d’un pastiche
      de génie.” Renan was nothing if not fastidious, and “unique” is a hard
      word, for which I should like to substitute the milder “rare.” Pastiches
      “of genius” are rare because genius is rare in any kind, and more than
      ever rare in that kind wherein the writer deliberately forgoes his own
      natural, instinctive form of expression for an alien form. But even fairly
      plausible pastiches are rare, for the simple reason that though, with
      taste and application, and above all an anxious care for style, you may
      succeed in mimicking the literary form of another author or another age,
      it is impossible for you to reproduce their spirit—since no two human
      beings in this world are identical. Perhaps the easiest of all kinds is
      the theatrical “imitation,” because all that is to be imitated is voice,
      tone, gesture—an actor’s words not being his own—yet I have never seen one
      that got beyond parody. The sense of an audience is not fine enough to
      appreciate exact imitation; it demands exaggeration, caricature.
    </p>

    <p align="center">
      Parody, indeed, is the pitfall of all pastiche. Even Mr. Max Beerbohm,
      extraordinarily susceptible and responsive to style as he is, did not
      escape it in that delightful little book of his wherein, some years ago,
      he imitated many of our contemporary authors. I can think of but a single
      instance which faithfully reproduces not only the language but almost the
      spirit of the authors imitated—M. Marcel Proust’s volume of “Pastiches et
      Mélanges.” The only stricture one can pass on it, if stricture it be, is
      that M. Proust’s Balzac and St. Simon and the rest are a little “more
      Royalist than the King,” a little more like Balzac and St. Simon than the
      originals themselves; I mean, a little too intensely, too concentratedly,
      Balzac and St. Simon. But Marcel Proust is one of my prejudices. To say
      that his first two books, “Swann” and “Les Jeunes Filles,” have given me
      more exquisite pleasure than anything in modern French literature would
      not be enough—I should have to say, in all modern literature. Mrs.
      Wharton, I see from the “Letters,” sent Henry James a copy of “Swann” when
      it first came out (1918): I wish we could have had his views of it. It
      offers another kind of psychology from Henry James’s, and he would
      probably have said, as he was fond of saying, that it had more
      “saturation” than “form.” But I am wandering from my subject of pastiche.
      I was present one afternoon at a curious experiment in theatrical
      pastiche. This was a rehearsal
    </p>
    <p>
      of a rehearsal of the screen scene from The School for Scandal, which was
      supposed to be directed by Sheridan himself. Rather a complicated affair,
      because Miss Lilian Braithwaite was supposed to be playing not Lady Teazle
      but Mrs. Abington playing Lady Teazle, Mr. Gilbert Hare had to play Mr.
      Parsons playing Sir Peter, and so forth—histrionics, so to speak, raised
      to the second power. To tell the truth, I think the middle term tended to
      fall out. It was easy enough for the players to make themselves up after
      the originals in the Garrick Club picture of the screen scene, but how
      these originals spoke or what their personal peculiarities were, on or off
      the stage, who shall now say? There you have the difference between fact
      and fiction. Lady Teazle and Sir Peter, having no existence save in the
      book of the play, are producible from it at any time, as “real” as they
      ever were, but Mrs. Abington and Mr. Parsons are not fixed in a book, and
      their reality died with them. Naturally enough the actual scene written by
      Sheridan “went” with very much greater force than the setting of
      conversations, interruptions, etc., in which it was embedded, for the
      simple reason that the one part had had the luck to be imagined by
      Sheridan and the other had not. But as a pastiche this new part, written
      round the old, seemed to me on the whole very well done; there was hardly
      a word that Sheridan and his friends might not have said. Just one,
      however, there noticeably was. Mr. Gerald du Maurier (as[4] Sheridan) was
      made to tell Mr. Leon Quartermaine (as Charles) that, in his laughter at
      the discovery of Lady Teazle, he was not to expect the “sympathy of the
      audience.” That, I feel sure, was an anachronism, a bit of quite modern
      theatrical lingo. I should guess that it came to us from the French, who
      are fond of talking of a rôle sympathique. Mr. du Maurier, if any one,
      must remember his father’s delightful sketch of English people shopping in
      Normandy, when the artful shopwoman is cajoling a foolish-faced Englishman
      with “le visage de monsieur m’est si sympathique.” The Italian simpatico
      is, of course, even more hard-worked. I felt sure, then, as I say, about
      the anachronism; but I am quite aware that it is never safe to trust to
      one’s instinct in these matters. It is by no means impossible that some
      one may triumphantly produce against me a newspaper or book of 1775 which
      speaks of “the sympathy of the audience.” The unexpected in these cases
      does occasionally happen.
    </p>

    <p align="center">
      And certainly any one who has tried his hand at a pastiche of a dead and
      gone author will have frequently been astonished, not at the antiquity but
      at the modernity of the style. Language changes less rapidly than we are
      apt to suppose. The bad writers seem to get old-fashioned
      earliest—because, I suppose, they yield most easily to ephemeral tricks of
      speech. For example, Fanny Burney, who, I cannot but think, wrote a bad
      style, and in her later books (as Macaulay pointed out) a kind of
      debased[5] Johnsonese, is now decidedly old-fashioned. But Jane Austen,
      whose style, though scarcely brilliant, was never bad, is not. A modern
      Mr. Collins would not talk of “elegant females”—but even then he was put
      forward as ridiculous for doing so. Jane was fond of “the chief of the
      day” and “the harp was bringing.” These phrases are passées, but I doubt
      if you will find many others.
    </p>

    Our sense of the past, in fact, may illude us. And that reminds me of Henry
    James’s solitary pastiche, his posthumous (and fragmentary) “Sense of the
    Past.” The “past” he deals with is, roughly, the Jane Austen period, and I
    think his language would very much have astonished Jane Austen. For one
    thing, they didn’t colloquially emphasize in her day as Henry James makes
    them do. I take a page at random:—“He mustn’t be too terribly clever for us,
    certainly! We enjoy immensely your being so extraordinary; but I’m sure
    you’ll take it in good part if I remind you that there is a limit.” Is this
    our ultra-modern Mrs. Brookenham speaking? No, it is Mrs. Midmore, somewhere
    about 1820. To be more exact, it is Henry James speaking with the emphasis
    that always abounded in his novels and his letters and his talk. Again: “I
    can’t keep off that strangeness of my momentary lapse.” That doesn’t sound
    to my ear a bit like 1820. Again: “It must have been one of your pale
    passions, as you call ’em, truly—so that even if her ghost does hover I
    shan’t be afraid of so very thin a shade.”[6] Note the “’em,” the author’s
    timid little speck of antique colour, but note also how the speaker carries
    on the “ghost” figure—in a way that is signed “Henry James, 19—” all over.
    The fact is, Henry James, with his marked, individual, curiously “modern”
    style, was the last man to express himself in an alien style, particularly
    the more simple style of an earlier age. To write a pure pastiche you must
    begin by surrendering, putting clean away your own personality—how otherwise
    are you to take on another’s?

    <p align="center">
      I have no illusions about the essays in pastiche to be found in the
      earlier of the following papers. If they do not always fall below parody,
      they never rise above it. Occasional fragments of authentic text will be
      recognized at a glance. “These Things are but Toyes.”

    <h2 align="center">AN ARISTOTELIAN FRAGMENT</h2>
    <br />
    <p>
      In the neighbourhood of Wardour Street, where the princes of the film hold
      their Court, a legislative code for film-making, a “Poetics” of the film,
      by some maestro di color che sanno, has long been yearned for. If only,
      they say, if only the maestro himself, the great Aristotle, had been alive
      to write it! After all, kinematograph is Greek, isn’t it? It seems to cry
      aloud, somehow, for its code by the great Greek authority. Well, they
      little knew what luck was in store for them!
    </p>

    <p>
      To-day comes a startling piece of news from the East. A certain Major
      Ferdinand M. Pinto, O.B.E., R.E., whether on military duty or on furlough
      the report does not say, has been sojourning with the monks of Mount
      Porthos, and, in the most singular manner, has discovered in the
      possession of his hosts a precious treasure of which they were entirely
      ignorant. It was a Greek manuscript, and, as the Reverend Prior laughingly
      observed, it was Greek to them. It seems that—such is the licence of
      modern manners even in monasteries—the monks have lately taken to smoking,
      and to using what in lay circles are called “spills.” Now on the spill
      which the Major was lighting for his cigar there suddenly stared him in
      the face the words
    </p>
    <br />

    <h4 align="center">ὥσπερ Ἀγάθων λέγει</h4>
    <br />

    <p>
      and the name Agathon thrilled him with memories of a certain Oxford quad,
      with dear “old Strachan” annoying the Master by wondering why Agathon
      should have said anything so obvious as that “it is probable that many
      things should happen contrary to probability. ” To examine the spill, all
      the spills collected, was the work of a moment. They proved, at a glance,
      to be an entirely unknown MS. of the “Poetics,” more complete even than
      the Parisian, and with new readings transcending even the acutest
      conjectures of Vahlen. But, greatest find of all, there was
      disclosed—though with unfortunate lacunæ caused by the monks’ cigars—an
      entirely new chapter inquiring into the structure of the Moving Picture
      Drama. Through the courtesy of the Pseudo-Hellenic Society I am favoured
      with a translation of this chapter, and a few passages, which seemed of
      more general interest, are here extracted.
    </p>
    <p>
      “As we have said,” the MS. begins, “it is a question whether tragedy is to
      be judged in itself or in relation also to the audience. But it is another
      story (ἄλλος λόγος) with the moving pictures. For it is not clear whether
      they have an ‘itself’ at all, or, if they have, where this self is to be
      found, whether on the screen, or in the lens of the camera, or in the head
      of the photographic artist. Whereas there is no doubt (save in very
      inclement weather) about the audience. They are to be judged, then, solely
      in relation to the audience. And, for this reason, they do not resemble
      tragedy, whose action, we said, must be whole, consisting of a beginning,
      a middle, and an end. For the audience may arrive at the end of a picture
      play, and though, in due time, the beginning will come round again, the
      audience may not have the patience to wait for it. Some audiences prefer
      to arrive in the middle and to proceed to the end, and then to end with
      the beginning. By this means the general sense of confusion in human
      affairs is confirmed in the picture theatre, and in this sense, but only
      in this sense, the picture drama may be said to be, like tragedy, an
      imitation of life.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Nor can it be said of picture drama, as it was of tragedy, that the
      element of plot is more important than the element of character. For here
      neither element is important. The important element now is motion. Any
      plot will serve the picture poet’s purpose (indeed most of them take them
      ready-made from those prose epics known as ‘shockers’), and any characters
      likewise (it will suffice if these be simplified types or ‘masks’). The
      essence of the matter is that all should be kept moving. And as moving
      objects are best seen to be moving when they are moving quickly, the
      picture poet will contrive that his horses shall always, as Homer
      says,devour the ground and his motor cars be ‘all out.’... Unity of
      plot—when there is a plot—does not, as some persons think, consist in the
      unity of the hero. It consists in the final dwelling together in unity of
      the hero and his bride. Final must be understood as posterior to the
      pursuit of the bride by other men, who may be either white or red. Red men
      are better, as more unbridled in their passions than white. As Æschylus
      first introduced a second actor in tragedy, so an American poet, whose
      name is too barbarous to be written in Greek, introduced the red man in
      picture drama....
    </p>
    <p>
      “With regard to the hero and his bride, though their characters should, as
      in tragedy, be morally good (χρηστά), it is chiefly necessary that their
      persons should be kinematographically good or good on the film. For at
      every peripety of the action they must become suddenly enlarged by the
      device of the photographer, so that every furrow of the knitted brow and
      every twitch of the agitated mouth is shown as large as life, if not
      larger. It is, in fact, by this photographic enlargement that the critical
      turns of the action are marked and distinguished, in the absence of the
      tragic element of diction. Where the tragic actor talks big, the picture
      player looks big. Nevertheless, the element of diction is not entirely
      wanting. Sentences (which should comprise as many solecisms as possible)
      may be shown on the screen, descriptive of what the players are doing or
      saying. But the more skilful players habitually say something else than
      what is thus imputed to them, thereby giving the audience the additional
      interest of conjecturing what they actually do say in place of what they
      ought to have said.
    </p>
    <p>
      ... “Picture poetry is a more philosophical and liberal thing than
      history; for history expresses the particular, but picture poetry the not
      too particular. The particular is, for example, what Alcibiades did or
      suffered. The not too particular is what Charlie Chaplin did or suffered.
      But the moving pictures do to some extent show actual happenings, in order
      to reassure people by nature incredulous. For what has not happened we do
      not at once feel sure to be possible; but what has happened is manifestly
      possible; otherwise it would not have happened. On the whole, however, as
      the tragic poet should prefer probable impossibilities to improbable
      possibilities, the picture poet should go, as Agathon says, one better,
      and aim at improbable impossibilities.”...

    <h2 align="center">MR. SHAKESPEARE DISORDERLY</h2>
    <br />
    <p>
      At the meeting preliminary to “Warriors’ Day” I was wending my way along
      the corridor of the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, when I encountered an
      amphibious-looking figure with the mien of one of Mr. W. W. Jacobs’s
      people, but attired in the classic tunic and sandals of a Greek of the
      best period. Knowing that the meeting was to include all sorts and
      conditions of theatrical men, I taxed him with being somebody out of
      Orphée aux Enfers or La Belle Hélène. He said it was not a bad shot, but,
      as a matter of fact, he was a ferryman, “saving your honour’s reverence,
      name o’ Charon.” “A ferryman?” said I; “then you must be from the Upper
      River, Godstow way.” “No, sir,” he answered, “I ply my trade on the Styx,
      and I’ve brought over a boatful of our tip-toppers—our
      intelli-gents-you-are they calls ’em in the Elysian Fields—to this ’ere
      meetin’. Precious dry work it is, too, sir,” he added, wiping his mouth
      with the back of his hand. “Where are they?” I asked in high excitement.
      “In this ’ere box, sir, where the management have allowed them to sit
      incog.” “And who, my good fellow, are they?” “Well, sir, let me see;
      there’s Mr. William Shakespeare, one of the most pop’lar of our gents and
      the neatest hand at nectar punch with a toast in it. Then there’s Mr.
      David Garrick, little Davy, as they calls ’im (though the other one, ’im
      who’s always a-slingin’ stones at the giants, isn’t no great size,
      neither), and there’s ’is friend Dr. Samuel Johnson, a werry harbitrary
      cove, and there’s Mrs. Siddons, an ’oly terror of a woman, sir, as you
      might say. Likewise, there’s Mr. Sheridan and Mr. Edmund Kean, both on ’em
      gents with a powerful thirst—just like mine this blessed mornin’, sir.” At
      this second reminder I gave him wherewithal to slake his thirst, directed
      him to the bar, and, as soon as he was out of sight, slipped noiselessly
      into the back of the box, where I hid behind the overcoats.
    </p>
    <p align="center">
      Mr. Shakespeare was beckoning Mrs. Siddons to his side. “Come hither, good
      mistress Sal” (this to the majestic Sarah, the Tragic Muse!), “and
      prythee, dearest chuck, sit close, for ’tis a nipping and an eager air,
      and poor Will’s a-cold.”
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. S.—Sir, you are vastly obleeging, but where’s the
      chair?
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Johnson.—Madam, you who have so often occasioned a want of seats to
      other people, will the more easily excuse the want of one yourself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Shakespeare.—Marry come up! Wouldst not sit in my lap, Sal? ’Tis not
      so deep as a well nor so wide as a church door, but ’twill serve.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. S. (scandalized but dignified).—Sir, I am[14] sensible of the honour,
      but fear my train would incommode the Immortal Bard.
    </p>
    <p>Mr. Shakespeare.—Oh, Immortal Bard be——</p>
    <p>
      Mr. Garrick <i>(hastily).</i>—I perceive, sir, a stir among the company.
      The gentleman who is taking the chair has notable eyebrows; he must be——
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Shakespeare.—Master George Robey. I’ve heard of him and his eyebrows.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. G.—No, no, ’tis Sir Arthur Pinero, an actor-dramatist like yourself,
      sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Shakespeare.—Beshrew me, but I would hear the chimes at midnight with
      him and drink a health unto his knighthood. <i>(Sings.)</i> “And let me
      the canakin clink, clink, and——”
    </p>
    <p>The House <i>(indignantly)</i>.—Sh-h-h!</p>
    <p>
      Mr. Shakespeare.—A murrain on these gallants! They have no ear for a catch
      and should get them to a monastery. But I’ll sit like my grandsire, carved
      in alabaster. Who’s the young spark, now speaking?
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. J. <i>(shocked).</i>—The young spark, sir, is His Royal Highness the
      Prince of Wales.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Sheridan.—Egad! This reminds me of old times, but the young man is not
      a bit like my friend Prinny. And though I managed Drury Lane, I never got
      Prinny on <i>my stage.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. J.—Sir, your Prinny never had so good a cause to be there. He only
      thought he fought in the wars; but this Prince is a real ex-Service
      man,[15] pleading for the ex-Service men, his comrades in arms. He has
      been a soldier, and not a man of us in this box but wishes he could say as
      much for himself. Every man thinks meanly of himself for not having been a
      soldier; but he will think less meanly if he can help those who have. That
      is the very purpose of this numerous assembly.
    </p>

    <p>
      Mr. Shakespeare.—Oh, most learned doctor, a Daniel come to judgment! I’
      faith I am most heartily of thy mind, and would drink a loving toast to
      the young Prince and another to the ex-Service fellows, and eke a third to
      this—how runs it?—this numerous assembly. <i>(Sings.)</i> “And let me the
      canakin clink, clink, and——”
    </p>
    <p>
      The House <i>(in a frenzy of indignation)</i>.—Sh-h-h! Turn him out!<i>
        (Hisses.)</i
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Shakespeare.—What! the “bird”! Well-a-day, this isn’t the first time
      they’ve hissed my Ghost.
    </p>
    <p>Mr. Kean.—Sir, they’ve hissed me!</p>
    <p>
      Mr. Shakespeare.—Ha! say’st thou, honest Ned! But thou wast a jackanapes
      to let thyself be caught with the Alderman’s wife and——
    </p>
    <p>Mrs. S. <i>(icily)</i>.—Mr. Shakespeare, there are ladies present.</p>
    <p>
      Mr. Sheridan <i>(whispering to Dr. J.)</i>.—But what does little Davy
      here, doctor? He has always been represented as very saving.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. J.—No, sir. Davy is a liberal man. He has given away more money than
      any man in England.[16] There may be a little vanity mixed, but he has
      shown that money is not his first object.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment Charon popped his head in at the door, pulling his
      forelock, and said, “Time, gen’lemen, time!” The house was rising and I
      took the opportunity to step back, unperceived, into the corridor. Mr.
      Shakespeare led the procession out, declaring that, as he had come in a
      galliard, he must return in a coranto, and offering to dance it with Mrs.
      Siddons, who, however, excused herself, saying that she knew no touch of
      it, though she had of old taken great strides in her profession. Dr.
      Johnson turned back, when half way out, to touch the doorpost. Mr. Garrick
      sallied forth arm-in-arm with Mr. Kean and Mr. Sheridan. “Egad!” chuckled
      Mr. Sheridan, “Garrick between Tragedy and Comedy,” and subsequently
      caused some confusion by tumbling down the stairs and lying helpless at
      the bottom. When the attendants ran to his assistance and asked his name,
      he said he was Mr. Wilberforce. As they emerged under the portico the
      crowd outside raised a loud cheer, and Mr. Shakespeare doffed his plumed
      cap and bowed graciously to right and left until they told him that the
      crowd were cheering the Prince of Wales, when he looked crestfallen and
      called those within earshot “groundlings” and “lousy knaves.” As he jumped
      into a taxi, I heard him direct the driver to the “Mermaid,” when Dr.
      Johnson, running up and puffing loudly, cried, “A tavern chair is the
      throne of human felicity. But the ‘Mitre’ is the nearer. Let us go there,
      and I’ll have a frisk with you.” And as the taxi disappeared down
      Catherine Street, my ear caught the distant strain, “And let me the
      canakin clink, clink.”

    </p>

    <br />
    <p>
      My friend Sir Roger de Coverley, when we last met together at the club,
      told me that he had a great mind to see the Muscovite dancers with me,
      assuring me at the same time that he had not been at a playhouse these
      twenty years. When he learnt from me that these dancers were to be sought
      in Leicester Fields, he asked me if there would not be some danger in
      coming home late, in case the Mohocks should be abroad. “However,” says
      the knight, “if Captain Sentry will make one with us to-morrow night, I
      will have my own coach in readiness to attend you; for John tells me he
      has got the fore-wheels mended.” Thinking to smoak him, I whispered, “You
      must have a care, for all the streets in the West are now up,” but he was
      not to be daunted, saying he minded well when all the West Country was up
      with Monmouth; and the Captain bid Sir Roger fear nothing, for that he had
      put on the same sword which he made use of at the battle of Steenkirk.
    </p>

    <p>
      When we had convoyed him in safety to Leicester Fields, and he had
      descended from his coach at the door, he straightway engaged in a
      conference with the door-keeper, who is a notable prating gossip, and
      stroak’d the page-boy upon the head, bidding him be a good child and mind
      his book. As soon as we were in our places my old friend stood up and
      looked about him with that pleasure which a mind seasoned with humanity
      naturally feels in itself, at the sight of a multitude of people who seem
      pleased with one another, and partake of the same common entertainment. He
      seemed to be no less pleased with the gay silks and satins and sarsenets
      and brocades of the ladies, but pish’d at the strange sight of their bare
      backs. “Not so bare, neither,” I whispered to him, “for if you look at
      them through your spy-glass you will see they wear a little coat of paint,
      which particularity has gained them the name of Picts.” “I warrant you,”
      he answered, with a more than ordinary vehemence, “these naked ones are
      widows—widows, Sir, are the most perverse creatures in the world.”
      Thinking to humour him, I said most like they were war widows, whereon the
      good knight lifted his hat to our brave fellows who fought in the Low
      Countries, and offered several reflections on the greatness of the British
      land and sea forces, with many other honest prejudices which naturally
      cleave to the heart of a true Englishman.
    </p>

    <p>
      Luckily, the Muscovites then began dancing and posturing in their
      pantomime which they call Petrouchka and the old gentleman was wonderfully
      attentive to the antics of the three live fantoccini. When the black
      fellow, as he called the Moor, clove the head of his rival with the
      scimitar, the knight said he had never looked for such barbarity from a
      fellow who, but a moment ago, was innocently playing a game of ball, like
      a child. What strange disorders, he added, are bred in the minds of men
      whose passions are not regulated by virtue, and disciplined by reason.
      “But pray, you that are a critic, is this in accordance with your rules,
      as you call them? Did your Aristotle allow pity and terror to be moved by
      such means as dancing?” I answered that the Greek philosopher had never
      seen the Muscovites and that, in any case, we had the authority of
      Shakespeare for expecting murder from any jealous Moor. “Moreover, these
      Muscovites dance murder as they dance everything. I love to shelter myself
      under the examples of great men, and let me put you in mind of Hesiod, who
      says, ‘The gods have bestowed fortitude on some men, and on others a
      disposition for dancing.’ Fortunately the Muscovites have the more amiable
      gift.” The knight, with the proper respect of a country gentleman for
      classick authority, was struck dumb by Hesiod.
    </p>

    <p>
      He remained silent during the earlier part of Schéhérazade until
      Karsavina, as the favourite of the Sultan’s harem, persuaded the Chief
      Eunuch to release her orange-tawny favourite, Monsieur Massine, at which
      the knight exclaimed, “On my word, a notable young baggage!” I refrained
      from telling my innocent friend that in the old Arabian tale these tawny
      creatures were apes. He mightily liked the Sultan’s long beard. “When I am
      walking in my gallery in the country,” says he, “and see the beards of my
      ancestors, I cannot forbear regarding them as so many old patriarchs, and
      myself as an idle smock-faced young fellow. I love to see your Abrahams
      and Isaacs, as we have them in old pieces of tapestry with beards below
      their girdles. I suppose this fellow, with all these wives, must be
      Solomon.” And, his thoughts running upon that King, he said he kept his
      Book of Wisdom by his bedside in the country and found it, though
      Apocryphal, more conducive to virtue than the writings of Monsieur La
      Rochefoucauld or, indeed, of Socrates himself, whose life he had read at
      the end of the Dictionary. Captain Sentry, seeing two or three wags who
      sat near us lean with an attentive ear towards Sir Roger, and fearing lest
      they should smoak the knight, plucked him by the elbow, and whispered
      something in his ear that lasted until the Sultan returned to the harem
      and put the ladies and their tawny companions to the sword. The
      favourite’s plunging the dagger into her heart moved him to tears, but he
      dried them hastily on bethinking him she was a Mahometan, and asked of us,
      on our way home, whether there was no playhouse in London where they
      danced true Church of England pantomimes.

    <h2 align="center">PARTRIDGE AT “JULIUS CÆSAR”</h2>
    <p>
      Mr. Jones having spent three hours in reading and kissing Sophia’s letter,
      and being at last in a state of good spirits, he agreed to carry an
      appointment, which he had before made, into execution. This was, to attend
      Mrs. Miller and her youngest daughter into the gallery at the St. James’s
      playhouse, and to admit Mr. Partridge as one of the company. For, as Jones
      had really that taste for humour which many affect, he expected to enjoy
      much entertainment in the criticisms of Partridge; from whom he expected
      the simple dictates of nature, unimproved, indeed, but likewise
      unadulterated by art.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the first row, then, of the first gallery did Mr. Jones, Mrs. Miller, h
      er youngest daughter, and Partridge take their places. Partridge
      immediately declared it was the finest place he had ever been in. When the
      first music was played he said it was a wonder how so many fiddlers could
      play at one time without putting one another out.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as the play, which was Shakespeare’s<i> Julius Cæsar</i> began,
      Partridge was all attention, nor did he break silence till the scene in
      Brutus’s orchard, when he asked Jones, “What season of the year is it,
      Sir?” Jones answered, “Wait but a moment and you shall hear the boy Lucius
      say it is the 14th of March.” To which Partridge replied with a smile,
      “Ay, then I understand why the boy was asleep. Had it been in
      apple-harvesting time I warrant you he would have been awake and busy as
      soon as what’s-his-name, Squire Brutus, had turned his back.” And upon the
      entreaties of Portia to share Brutus’s confidence he inquired if she was
      not a Somersetshire wench. “For Madam,” said he, “is mighty like the
      housewives in our county, who will plague their husbands to death rather
      than let ’em keep a secret.” Nor was he satisfied with Cæsar’s yielding to
      Calphurnia’s objections against his going to the Capitol. “Ay, anything to
      please your wife, you old dotard,” said he; “you might have known better
      than to give heed to a silly woman’s nightmares.”
    </p>

    <p>
      When they came to the Forum scene and the speeches of Brutus and Antony,
      Partridge sat with his eyes fixed on the orators and with his mouth open.
      The same passions which succeeded each other in the crowd of citizens
      succeeded likewise in him. He was at first all for Brutus and then all for
      Antony, until he learnt that Cæsar had left 75 drachmas to every Roman
      citizen. “How much is that in our English money?” he asked Jones, who
      answered that it was about two guineas. At that he looked chapfallen,
      bethinking him that, though a[24] round sum, it was not enough to warrant
      the crowd in such extravagant rejoicing.
    </p>

    <p>
      “I begin to suspect, Sir,” said he to Jones, “this Squire Antony hath not
      been above hoodwinking us, but he seemed so much more concerned about the
      matter than the other speaker, Brutus, that I for one couldn’t help
      believing every word he said. Yet I believed the other one, too, when he
      was talking, and I was mightily pleased with what he said about liberty
      and Britons never being slaves.” “You mean Romans,” answered Jones, “not
      Britons.” “Well, well,” said Partridge, “I know it is only a play, but if
      I thought they were merely Romans, and not Britons at heart, I should not
      care a hang about ’em or what became of ’em.”
    </p>

    <p>
      To say the truth, I believe honest Partridge, though a raw country fellow
      and ignorant of those dramatic rules which learned critics from the Temple
      and the other Inns of Court have introduced, along with improved catcalls,
      into our playhouses, was here uttering the sentiments of nature. Should we
      be concerned about the fortunes of those ancient Romans were they utter
      strangers to us and did we not put ourselves in their places, which is as
      much as to turn them all from Romans into Britons? To be sure, while our
      imagination is thus turning them, it will not forbear a few necessary
      amendments for the sake of verisimilitude. For, to name only one
      particular, no free and independent Briton could imagine himself bribed by
      so paltry a legacy as a[25] couple of guineas; but he can multiply that
      sum in his mind until it shall have reached the much more considerable
      amount which he will consent to take for his vote at a Westminster
      election; and thus honour will be satisfied. And the critics aforesaid
      will then be able to point out to us the advantages of British over Roman
      liberty, being attended not only with the proud privileges of our great
      and glorious Constitution, but also with a higher emolument.
    </p>

    <p>
      Mr. Jones would doubtless have made these reflections to himself had he
      not, while Partridge was still speaking, been distracted by the sudden
      appearance in an opposite box of Lady Bellaston and Sophia. As he had only
      left her ladyship that very afternoon, after a conversation of so private
      a nature that it must on no account be communicated to the reader, he
      would have disregarded the imperious signals which she forthwith began
      making to him with her fan; but the truth is, whatever reluctance he may
      have felt to rejoin her ladyship at that moment was overborne by his
      eagerness to approach the amiable Sophia, though he turned pale and his
      knees trembled at the risk of that approach in circumstances so dangerous.
      As soon as he had recovered his composure he hastened to obey her
      ladyship’s commands, but on his entry into the box his spirits were again
      confounded by the evident agitation of Sophia, and, seizing her hand, he
      stammered, “Madam, I——.” “Hoity, toity! Mr.[26] Jones,” cried Lady
      Bellaston; “do you salute a chit of a girl before you take notice of a
      dowager? Are these the new manners among people of fashion? It is lucky
      for my heart that I can call myself a dowager, for I vow to-night you look
      like a veritable Adonis, and,” she added in a whisper too low to be heard
      by Sophia, “your Venus adores you more madly than ever, you wicked
      wretch.”
    </p>

    <p>
      Jones was ready to sink with fear. He sat kicking his heels, playing with
      his fingers, and looking more like a fool, if it be possible, than a young
      booby squire when he is at first introduced into a polite assembly. He
      began, however, now to recover himself; and taking a hint from the
      behaviour of Lady Bellaston, who, he saw, did not intend openly to claim
      any close acquaintance with him, he resolved as entirely to affect the
      stranger on his part. Accordingly, he leaned over to Sophia, who was
      staring hard at the stage, and asked her if she enjoyed the performance.
      “Pray, don’t tease Miss Western with your civilities,” interrupted Lady
      Bellaston, “for you must know the child hath lost her heart this night to
      that ravishing fellow Ainley, though I tell her to my certain knowledge he
      is a husband already, and, what is more, a father. These country girls
      have nothing but sweethearts in their heads.” “Upon my honour, madam,”
      cried Sophia, “your ladyship injures me.” “Not I, miss, indeed,” replied
      her ladyship tartly, “and if you want a sweetheart, have you not one of
      the most gallant[27] young fellows about town ready to your hand in Lord
      Fellamar? You must be an arrant mad woman to refuse him.” Sophia was
      visibly too much confounded to make any observations, and again turned
      towards the stage, Lady Bellaston taking the opportunity to dart
      languishing glances at Jones behind her back and to squeeze his hand; in
      short, to practise the behaviour customary with women of fashion who
      desire to signify their sentiments for a gentleman without expressing them
      in actual speech; when Jones, who saw the agitation of Sophia’s mind,
      resolved to take the only method of relieving her, which was by retiring.
      This he did, as Brutus was rushing upon his own sword; and poor Jones
      almost wished the sword might spit him, too, in his rage and despair at
      what her ladyship had maliciously insinuated about Sophia and Mr. Ainley.

    <h2 align="center">DR. JOHNSON AT THE STADIUM</h2>
    <p>
      I am now to record a curious incident in Dr. Johnson’s life, which fell
      under my own observation; of which,<i> pars magna fui</i>, and which I am
      persuaded will, with the liberal-minded, be in no way to his discredit.
    </p>

    <p>
      When I was a boy in the year 1745 I wore a white cockade and prayed for
      King James, till one of my uncles gave me a shilling on condition that I
      should pray for King George, which I accordingly did. This uncle was
      General Cochran; and it was with natural gratification that I received
      from another member of that family, Mr. Charles Cochran, a more valuable
      present than a shilling, that is to say, an invitation to witness the
      Great Fight at the Stadium and to bring with me a friend. “Pray,” said I,
      “let us have Dr. Johnson.” Mr. Cochran, who is much more modest than our
      other great theatre-manager, Mr. Garrick, feared that Dr. Johnson could
      hardly be prevailed upon to condescend. “Come,” said I, “if you’ll let me
      negotiate for you, I will be answerable that all shall go well.”
    </p>

    <p>
      I had not forgotten Mrs. Thrale’s relation (which she afterwards printed
      in her “Anecdotes”) that[29] “Mr. Johnson was very conversant in the art
      of attack and defence by boxing, which science he had learned from his
      uncle Andrew, I believe; and I have heard him discourse upon the age when
      people were received, and when rejected, in the schools once held for that
      brutal amusement, much to the admiration of those who had no expectation
      of his skill in such matters, from the sight of a figure which precluded
      all possibility of personal prowess.” This lively lady was, however, too
      ready to deviate from exact authenticity of narration; and, further, I
      reflected that, whatever the propensities of his youth, he who had now
      risen to be called by Dr. Smollett the Great Cham of literature might well
      be affronted if asked to countenance a prize-fight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Notwithstanding the high veneration which I entertained for him, I was
      sensible that he was sometimes a little actuated by the spirit of
      contradiction, and by means of that I hoped I should gain my point. I
      therefore, while we were sitting quietly by ourselves at his house in an
      evening, took occasion to open my plan thus:—“Mr. Cochran, sir, sends his
      respectful compliments to you, and would be happy if you would do him the
      honour to visit his entertainment at the Stadium on Thursday next?”
      Johnson.—“Sir, I am obliged to Mr. Cochran. I will go——”
      Boswell.—“Provided, sir, I suppose, that the entertainment is of a kind
      agreeable to you?” Johnson.—“What do you mean, sir? What do you take me
      for? Do you think I am so ignorant of the world as to imagine that I am to
      prescribe to a gentleman what kind of entertainment he is to offer his
      friends?” Boswell.—“But if it were a prize-fight?” Johnson.—“Well, sir,
      and what then?” Boswell.—“It might bring queer company.” Johnson.—“My dear
      friend, let us have no more of this. I am sorry to be angry with you; but
      really it is treating me strangely to talk to me as if I could not meet
      any company whatever occasionally.” Thus I secured him.
    </p>
    <p>
      As it proved, however, whether by good luck or by the forethought of the
      ingenious Mr. Cochran, Dr. Johnson could not have found himself in better
      company than that gathered round him in Block H at the Stadium. There were
      many members of the Literary Club, among them Mr. Beauclerk, Mr. Burke,
      Mr. Garrick, Mr. Gibbon, Sir Joshua Reynolds, and Mr. R. B. Sheridan. A
      gentleman present, who had been dining at the Duke of Montrose’s, where
      the bottle had been circulated pretty freely, was rash enough to rally Dr.
      Johnson about his Uncle Andrew, suggesting that his uncle’s nephew might
      now take the opportunity of exhibiting his prowess in the ring.
      Johnson.—“Sir, to be facetious, it is not necessary to be indecent. I am
      not for tapping any man’s claret, but we see that thou hast already tapped
      his Grace’s.” Burke.—“It is remarkable how little gore is ever shed in
      these contests. Here have we been for half an hour watching—let me see,
      what are their names?—Eddie Feathers and Gus Platts—and not even a
      bleeding nose between them.” Reynolds.—“In a previous contest one boxer
      knocked the other’s teeth out.” Sheridan.—“Yes, but they were false
      teeth.”
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment the talk was interrupted by the arrival of the Prince. As
      His Highness passed Dr. Johnson, my revered friend made an obeisance which
      was an even more studied act of homage than his famous bow to the
      Archbishop of York; and he subsequently joined in singing “For he’s a
      jolly good fellow” with the most loyal enthusiasm, repeating the word
      “fe-ellow” over and over again, doubtless because it was the only one he
      knew. (“Like a word in a catch,” Beauclerk whispered.) I am sorry that I
      did not take note of an eloquent argument in which he proceeded to
      maintain that the situation of Prince of Wales was the happiest of any
      person’s in the kingdom, even beyond that of the Sovereign.
    </p>
    <p>
      But there was still no sign of Beckett and Carpentier, the heroes of the
      evening, and the company became a little weary of the preliminary
      contests. A hush fell upon the assembly, and many glanced furtively
      towards the alley down which the champions were to approach. Gibbon.—“We
      are unhappy because we are kept waiting. ‘Man never is, but always to be,
      blest.’” Johnson.—“And we are awaiting we know not what. To the impatience
      of expectation is added the disquiet of the unknown.” Garrick (playing
      round his old friend with a fond vivacity).—“My dear sir, men are
      naturally a little restless, when they have backed Beckett at 70 to 40.”
      Reynolds.—“But, see, the lights of the kinematographers” (we were all
      abashed by the word in the presence of the Great Lexicographer) “are
      brighter than ever. I observe all the contestants take care to smile under
      them.” Sheridan.—“When they do agree, their unanimity is wonderful.”
      Johnson.—“Among the anfractuosities of the human mind, I know not if it
      may not be one, that there is a morbid longing to attitudinize in the
      ‘moving pictures.’”
    </p>

    <p>
      But at length Beckett and Carpentier made their triumphal entry. Beckett
      first, quietly smiling, with eyes cast down, Carpentier debonair and
      lightly saluting the crowd with an elegant wave of the hand. After the
      pair had stripped and Dr. Johnson had pointed out that “the tenuity, the
      thin part” in Carpentier’s frame indicated greater lightness, if Beckett’s
      girth promised more solid resistance, Mr. Angle invited the company to
      preserve silence during the rounds and to abstain from smoking. To add a
      last touch to the solemnity of the moment, Carpentier’s supernumerary
      henchmen (some six or eight, over and above his trainer and seconds) came
      and knelt by us, in single file, in the alley between Block H and Block E,
      as though at worship.
    </p>
    <p>
      What then happened, in the twinkling of an eye, all the world now knows,
      and knows rather better than I knew myself at the moment, for I saw
      Beckett lying on his face in the ring without clearly distinguishing the
      decisive blow. While Carpentier was being carried round the ring on the
      shoulders of his friends, being kissed first by his trainer and then by
      ladies obligingly held up to the ring for the amiable purpose, I confess
      that I watched Beckett, and was pleased to see he had successfully resumed
      his quiet smile. As I carried my revered friend home to Bolt Court in a
      taximetric cabriolet, I remarked to him that Beckett’s defeat was a blow
      to our patriotic pride, whereupon he suddenly uttered, in a strong,
      determined tone, an apophthegm at which many will start:—“Patriotism is
      the last refuge of a scoundrel!” “And yet,” said Beauclerk, when I told
      him of this later, “he had not been kissed by Carpentier.”

    <h2 align="center">MY UNCLE TOBY PUZZLED</h2>
    <p>
      “’Tis a pity,” cried my father, one winter’s night, after reading the
      account of the Shakespeare Memorial meeting—“’tis a pity,” cried my
      father, putting my mother’s thread-paper into the newspaper for a mark as
      he spoke,—“that truth, brother Toby, should shut herself up in such
      impregnable fastnesses, and be so obstinate as to surrender herself up
      sometimes only upon the closest siege.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The word siege, like a talismanic power, in my father’s metaphor, wafting
      back my uncle Toby’s fancy, quick as a note could follow the touch, he
      opened his ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      “And there was nothing to shame them in the truth, neither,” said my
      father, “seeing that they had many thousands of pounds to their credit.
      How could a bishop think there was danger in telling it?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Lord bless us! Mr. Shandy,” cried my mother, “what is all this story
      about?”
    </p>
    <p>“About Shakespeare, my dear,” said my father.</p>
    <p>“He has been dead a hundred years ago,” replied my mother.</p>
    <p>My uncle Toby, who was no chronologer, whistled “Lillibullero.”</p>
    <p>
      “By all that’s good and great! ma’am,” cried my father, taking the oath
      out of Ernulphus’s digest, “of course. If it was not for the aids of
      philosophy, which befriend one so much as they do, you would put a man
      beside all temper. He is as dead as a doornail, and they are thinking of
      building a theatre to honour his memory.”
    </p>
    <p>“And why should they not, Mr. Shandy?” said my mother.</p>
    <p>
      “To be sure, there’s no reason why,” replied my father, “save that they
      haven’t enough money left over after buying a plot of land in Gower Street
      to build upon.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Corporal Trim touched his Montero-cap and looked hard at my uncle Toby.
      “If I durst presume,” said he, “to give your honour my advice, and speak
      my opinion in this matter.” “Thou art welcome, Trim,” said my uncle Toby.
      “Why then,” replied Trim, “I think, with humble submission to your
      honour’s better judgment, I think that had we but a rood or a rood and a
      half of this ground to do what we pleased with, I would make
      fortifications for you something like a tansy, with all their batteries,
      saps, ditches, and palisadoes, that it should be worth all the world’s
      riding twenty miles to go and see it.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Then thou wouldst have, Trim,” said my father, “to palisado the Y.M.C.A.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I never understood rightly the meaning of that word,” said my Uncle Toby,
      “and I am sure nothing of that name was known to our armies in Flanders.”
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“’Tis an association of Christian young men,” replied
      my father, “who for the present hold the Shakespeare Memorialists’ ground
      in Gower Street.” ’Twas no inconsistent part of my uncle Toby’s character
      that he feared God and reverenced religion. So the moment my father
      finished his remark my uncle Toby fell a-whistling “Lillibullero” with
      more zeal (though more out of tune) than usual.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; “And the money these Christian youths pay for rents,”
      continued my father, “is to be used to maintain a company of strolling
      players” [Here my uncle Toby, throwing back his head, gave a monstrous,
      long, loud whew-w-w.], “who are to go up and down the country showing the
      plays of Shakespeare. Up and down, and that, by the way, is how their
      curtain went on twenty-two occasions in<i> Romeo and Juliet.</i>”
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Who says so?” asked my uncle Toby.</p>
    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“A parson,” replied my father.</p>
    <p>
      &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Had he been a soldier,” said my uncle, “he would never
      have told such a taradiddle. He would have known that the curtain is that
      part of the wall or rampart which lies between the two bastions, and joins
      them.”
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; “By the mother who bore us! brother Toby,” quoth my
      father, “you would provoke a saint. Here have you got us, I know not how,
      souse into the middle of the old subject again. We are speaking of
      Shakespeare and not of fortifications.”
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; “Was Shakespeare a soldier, Mr. Shandy, or a young
      men’s Christian?” said my mother, who had lost her way in the argument.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; “Neither one nor t’other, my dear,” replied my father
      (my uncle Toby softly whistled “Lillibullero”); “he was a writer of
      plays.”
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“They are foolish things,” said my mother.</p>
    <p>
      &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Sometimes,” replied my father, “but you have not seen
      Shakespeare’s, Mrs. Shandy. And it is for the like of you, I tell you
      point-blank——”
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;As my father pronounced the word point-blank my uncle
      Toby rose up to say something upon projectiles, but my father continued:—
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“It is for the like of you that these Shakespeare
      Memorialists are sending their strolling players around the country, to
      set the goodwives wondering about Shakespeare, as they wondered about
      Diego’s nose in the tale of the learned Hafen Slawkenbergius.”
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; “Surely the wonderful nose was Cyrano’s?” said my
      mother. “Cyrano’s or Diego’s, ’tis all one,” cried my father in a passion.
      “Zooks! Cannot a man use a plain analogy but his wife must interrupt him
      with her foolish questions about it? May the eternal curse of all the
      devils in——”
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Our armies swore terribly in Flanders,” cried my uncle
      Toby, “but nothing to this.”
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“As you please, Mr. Shandy,” said my mother.</p>
    <p>
      &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Where was I?” said my father, in some confusion, and
      letting his hand fall upon my uncle Toby’s shoulder in sign of repentance
      for his violent cursing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“You was at Slawkenbergius,” replied my uncle Toby.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“No, no, brother, Shakespeare, I was speaking of
      Shakespeare, and how they were going to carry him round the country
      because they had not money enough to build a theatre for him in London.”
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“But could they not hire one?” said my uncle Toby.</p>
    <p>
      &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“No, for my Lord Lytton said that would be too
      speculative a venture.”
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“’Tis a mighty strange business,” said my uncle, in
      much perplexity. “They buy their land, as I understand it, brother, to
      build a house for Shakespeare in London, but lease it for a house for
      young Christians instead, and spend their money on sending Shakespeare
      packing out of London.”
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;’Tis all the fault of the Londoners,” replied my
      father. “They have no soul for Shakespeare, and for that matter, as I
      believe, no soul at all.”
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“A Londoner has no soul, an’ please your honour,”
      whispered Corporal Trim doubtingly, and touching his Montero-cap to my
      uncle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“I am not much versed, Corporal,” quoth my uncle Toby,
      “in things of that kind; but I suppose God would not leave him without
      one, any more than thee or me.”
    </p>

    <h2 align="center">LADY CATHERINE AND MR. COLLINS</h2>
    <p>
      Elizabeth and Charlotte were seated one morning in the parlour at Hunsford
      parsonage, enjoying the prospect of Rosings from the front window, and Mr.
      Collins was working in his garden, which was one of his most respectable
      pleasures, when the peace of the household was suspended by the arrival of
      a letter from London:—
    </p>
    <p align="right">
      “Theatre Royal, Drury Lane,
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
      “London,<i>December, 19—.</i>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p align="center">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Dear
      Cousin William,—We have long neglected to maintain a commerce of letters,
      but I have learned through the public prints of your recent union with an
      elegant female from Hertfordshire and desire to tender you and your lady
      my respects in what I trust will prove an agreeable form. I am directing
      an entertainment at this theatre, which is designed to be in harmony with
      the general Christmas rejoicings, and, you may rest assured, in no way
      offends the principles of the Church which you adorn. Will you not honour
      it by your presence and thus confer an innocent enjoyment upon your lady?
      In that hope, I enclose a box[40] ticket for the pantomime on Monday
      se’nnight and remain your well-wisher and cousin,
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    </p>
    <br />
    <p align="right">
      “Arthur Collins.”
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
      Smiling to herself, Elizabeth reflected that the two Messrs. Collins might
      certainly call cousins in epistolary composition, while Charlotte
      anxiously inquired if the proposal had her William’s approval.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I am by no means of opinion,” said he, “that an entertainment of this
      kind, given by a man of character, who is also my own second cousin, to
      respectable people, can have any evil tendency; but, before accepting the
      invitation, it is, of course, proper that I should seek the countenance of
      Lady Catherine de Bourgh.” Accordingly, he lost no time in making his way
      to Rosings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Catherine, who chanced to be meditating that very morning on a visit
      to London for the purchase of a new bonnet and pèlerine, was all
      affability and condescension.
    </p>
    <p>
      To be sure, you will go, Mr. Collins,” said her ladyship. “I advise you to
      accept the invitation without delay. It is the duty of a clergyman of your
      station to refine and improve such entertainments by his presence. Nay,”
      she added, “Sir Lewis highly approved them and I myself will go with you.”
      Mr. Collins was overwhelmed by civility far beyond his expectations, and
      hurried away to prepare Charlotte and Elizabeth for this splendid addition
      to their party.
    </p>
    <p>
      Early on the Monday se’nnight they set out for London in one of her
      ladyship’s carriages, for, as Mr. Collins took the opportunity of
      remarking, she had several, drawn by four post-horses, which they changed
      at the “Bell” at Bromley. On the way her ladyship examined the young
      ladies’ knotting-work and advised them to do it differently, instructed
      Elizabeth in the humility of deportment appropriate to the front seat of a
      carriage, and determined what the weather was to be to-morrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they were at last arrived and seated in their box Lady Catherine
      approved the spacious dignity of the baronial hall, which, she said,
      reminded her of the great gallery at Pemberley, but was shocked at the
      familiarities which passed between the Baron and Baroness Beauxchamps and
      their page-boy. “These foreign nobles,” she exclaimed, “adventurers, I
      daresay! It was Sir Lewis’s opinion that all foreigners were adventurers.
      No English baron, it is certain, would talk so familiarly to a common
      domestic, a person of inferior birth, and of no importance in the world.
      Honour, decorum, prudence, nay, interest, forbid it. With such manners, I
      do not wonder that the domestic arrangements are in disorder, the very
      stair-carpet unfastened, and a machine for cleaning knives actually
      brought into a reception room! See, they cannot even lay a table-cloth!”
      And her ladyship advised Charlotte on the proper way of laying
      table-cloths, especially in clergymen’s families.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a song of Miss Florence Smithson’s Charlotte talked in a low tone
      with Elizabeth, and her ladyship called out:—“What is that you are saying,
      Mrs. Collins? What is it you are talking of? What are you telling Miss
      Bennet? Let me hear what it is.”
    </p>
    <p>“We are speaking of music, madam,” said Charlotte.</p>
    <p>
      “Of music! Then pray speak aloud. It is of all subjects my delight. I must
      have my share in the conversation, if you are speaking of music. There are
      few people in England, I suppose, who have more true enjoyment of music
      than myself, or a better natural taste. If I had ever learnt, I should
      have been a great proficient.”
    </p>
    <p>
      When Cinderella set out for the ball in her coach-and-six with a whole
      train of running-footmen Lady Catherine signified her approbation. “Young
      women should always be properly guarded and attended, according to their
      situation in life. When my niece Georgiana went to Ramsgate last summer, I
      made a point of her having two men-servants go with her. I am excessively
      attentive to all those things.”
    </p>
    <p>
      But now they were at the ball, and the box party was all attention. The
      Prince, dignified and a little stiff, reminded Elizabeth of Mr. Darcy. But
      guests so strange as Mutt and Jeff, she thought, would never be allowed to
      pollute the shades of Pemberley. Mr. Collins’s usually cold composure
      forsook him at the sight of the Baroness playing cards with the[43] Baron
      on one of her paniers as a table, and felt it his duty to apologize to
      Lady Catherine for the unseemly incident. “If your ladyship will warrant
      me,” he began, “I will point out to my cousin that neither a person of
      your high station nor a clergyman of the Church of England ought to be
      asked to witness this licentiousness of behaviour.” “And advise him,” said
      her ladyship, “on the authority of Lady Catherine de Bourgh, that paniers
      were never used for this disgraceful purpose. There is no one in England
      who knows more about paniers than myself, for my grandmother, Lady Anne,
      wore them, and some day Mrs. Jennings, the housekeeper, shall show them to
      Miss Bennet,” for Elizabeth could not forbear a smile, “at Rosings.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The party retired early, for Elizabeth had to be conveyed to her uncle’s
      as far as Gracechurch Street, and Lady Catherine desired the interval of a
      long night before choosing her new bonnet. It was not until Mr. Collins
      was once more in his parsonage that he sent his cousin an acknowledgment
      of the entertainment afforded at Drury Lane, as follows:—
    </p>
    <p align="right">
      “Hunsford, near Westerham, Kent,
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Dear Sir,—We withdrew from your Christmas entertainment on Monday last
      with mingled feelings of gratification and reprobation. When I say ‘we’ I
      should tell you that my Charlotte and I not only brought with us a Miss
      Elizabeth Bennet, one of[44] the friends of her maiden state, but were
      honoured by the company of the Right Honourable Lady Catherine de Bourgh,
      widow of Sir Lewis de Bourgh, whose bounty and beneficence have, as you
      know, preferred me to the valuable rectory of this parish, where it shall
      be my earnest endeavour to demean myself with grateful respect towards her
      ladyship, and be ever ready to perform those rites and ceremonies which
      are instituted by the Church of England. It is as a clergyman that I feel
      it my duty to warn you against the sinful game of cards exhibited in the
      scene of the Prince’s ball. If it had been family whist, I could have
      excused it, for there can be little harm in whist, at least among players
      who are not in such circumstances as to make five shillings any object.
      But the Baroness Beauxchamps is manifestly engaged in a game of sheer
      chance, if not of downright cheating. The admission of this incident to
      your stage cannot but have proceeded, you must allow me to tell you, from
      a faulty degree of indulgence. And I am to add, on the high authority of
      Lady Catherine, probably the highest on this as on many other subjects,
      that there is no instance on record of the paniers once worn by ladies
      being used as card-tables. With respectful compliments to your lady and
      family,
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

    <br>
    <h2 align="center">MR. PICKWICK AT THE PLAY</h2>
    <p>“And now,” said Mr. Pickwick, looking round on his friends with a good-humoured smile, and a sparkle in the eye which no spectacles could dim or conceal, “the question is, Where shall we go to-night?”</p>
    <p>With the faithful Sam in attendance behind his chair, he was seated at the head of his own table, with Mr. Snodgrass on his left and Mr. Winkle on his right and Mr. Alfred Jingle opposite him; his face was rosy with jollity, for they had just dispatched a hearty meal of chops and tomato sauce, with bottled ale and Madeira, and a special allowance of milk punch for the host.</p>
    <p>Mr. Jingle proposed Mr. Pickwick; and Mr. Pickwick proposed Mr. Jingle. Mr. Snodgrass proposed Mr. Winkle; and Mr. Winkle proposed Mr. Snodgrass; while Sam, taking a deep pull at the stone bottle of milk punch behind his master’s chair, silently proposed himself.</p>
  <p>“And where,” said Mr. Pickwick, “shall we go to-night?” Mr. Snodgrass, as modest as all great geniuses are, was silent. Mr. Winkle, who had been thinking of Arabella, started violently, looked[46] knowing, and was beginning to stammer something, when he was interrupted by Mr. Jingle—“A musical comedy, old boy—no plot—fine women—gags—go by-by—wake up for chorus—entertaining, very.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“And lyrics,” said Mr. Snodgrass, with poetic rapture.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I was just going to suggest it,” said Mr. Winkle, “when this individual” (scowling at Mr. Jingle, who laid his hand on his heart, with a derisive smile), “when, I repeat, this individual interrupted me.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“A musical comedy, with all my heart,” said Mr. Pickwick. “Sam, give me the paper. H’m, h’m, what’s this?<i> The Eclipse</i>, a farce with songs—will that do?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“But is a farce with songs a musical comedy?” objected Mr. Winkle.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Bless my soul,” said Mr. Pickwick, “this is very puzzling.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Beggin’ your pardon, sir,” said Sam, touching his forelock, “it’s a distinction without a difference—as the pork pieman remarked when they asked him if his pork wasn’t kittens.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Then,” said Mr. Pickwick, with a benevolent twinkle, “by all means let us go to <i>The Eclipse.</i>”</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Beg pardon, sir,” said Sam again, doubtfully, “there ain’t no astrongomies in it, is there?” Sam had not forgotten his adventure with the scientific gentleman at Clifton. But, as nobody knew, they[47] set off for the Garrick Theatre, and were soon ensconced in a box.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They found the stage occupied by a waiter, who was the very image of the waiter Mr. Pickwick had seen at the Old Royal Hotel at Birmingham, except that he didn’t imperceptibly melt away. Waiters, in general, never walk or run; they have a peculiar and mysterious power of skimming out of rooms which other mortals possess not. But this waiter, unlike his kind, couldn’t “get off” anyhow. He explained that it was because the composer had given him no music to “get off” with.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Poor fellow,” said Mr. Pickwick, greatly distressed; “will he have to stop there all night?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Not,” muttered Sam to himself, “if I wos behind ’im with a bradawl.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the waiter did at last get off, and then came on again and sang another verse, amid loud hoorays, until Mr. Pickwick’s eyes were wet with gratification at the universal jollity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Fine fellow, fine fellow,” cried Mr. Pickwick; “what is his name?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Hush-h-h, my dear sir,” whispered a charming young man of not much more than fifty in the next box, in whom Mr. Pickwick, abashed, recognized Mr. Angelo Cyrus Bantam, “that is Mr. Alfred Lester.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“A born waiter,” interjected Mr. Jingle, “once a waiter always a waiter—stage custom—Medes and Persians—wears his napkin for a nightcap—droll fellow, very.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By and by there was much talk of a mysterious Tubby Haig, and they even sang a song about him; but he did not appear on the stage, and Mr. Pickwick, whose curiosity was excited, asked who this Tubby Haig was.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sam guessed he might be own brother to Mr. Wardle’s Fat Boy, Joe, or perhaps “the old gen’l’m’n as wore the pigtail—reg’lar fat man, as hadn’t caught a glimpse of his own shoes for five-and-forty year,” but Mr. Bantam again leaned over from his box and whispered:—</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Hush-h-h, my dear sir, nobody is fat or old in Ba-a——I mean in literary circles. Mr. Tubby Haig is a popular author of detective stories, much prized, along with alleytors and commoneys, by the youth of this town.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But a sudden start of Mr. Winkle’s and a rapturous exclamation from Mr. Snodgrass again directed Mr. Pickwick’s attention to the scene. He almost fainted with dismay. Standing in the middle of the stage, in the full glare of the lights, was a lady with her shoulders and back (which she kept turning to the lights) bare to the waist!</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Bless my soul,” cried Mr. Pickwick, shrinking behind the curtain of the box, “what a dreadful thing!”</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He mustered up courage, and looked out again. The lady was still there, not a bit discomposed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Most extraordinary female, this,” thought Mr. Pickwick, popping in again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She still remained, however, and even threw an arch glance in Mr. Pickwick’s direction, as much as to say, “You old dear.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Bless your heart, no, sir,” said Sam, “she’s quite used to it, and it’s done with the very best intentions, as the gen’l’man said ven he run away from his wife, ’cos she seemed unhappy with him.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Mr. Pickwick was distressed, very different was the effect of the lovely vision upon Mr. Winkle. Alas for the weakness of human nature! he forgot for the moment all about Arabella. Suddenly grasping his hat, he rose from his seat, said “Good-night, my dear sir,” to Mr. Pickwick between his set teeth, added brokenly, “My friend, my benefactor, my honoured companion, do not judge me harshly”—and dashed out of the box.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Very extraordinary,” said Mr. Pickwick to himself, “what can that young man be going to do?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile, for Mr. Winkle to rush downstairs, into the street, round the corner, as far as the stage-door, was the work of a moment. Taking out a card engraved “Nathaniel Winkle, M.P.C.,” he hastily pencilled a few fervent words on it and handed it to the door-keeper, requiring him instantly to convey it to Miss Teddie Gerard.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“What now, imperence,” said the man, roughly pushing him from the door and knocking his hat over his eyes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same moment Mr. Winkle found his arms pinioned from behind by Sam Weller, who led him, crestfallen, back into the street and his senses. The public were now leaving the theatre, and Mr. Pickwick, beckoning Mr. Winkle to approach, fixed a searching look upon him, and uttered in a low, but distinct and emphatic, tone these remarkable words:—</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“You’re a humbug, sir.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“A what!” said Mr. Winkle, starting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“A humbug, sir.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With these words, Mr. Pickwick turned slowly on his heel, and rejoined his friends.</p>

<br>
<h2 align="center">MR. CRICHTON AND MR. LITTIMER</h2>
<br>
<p>They were seated together, Mr. and Mrs. Crichton in the bar-parlour of their little public-house in the Harrow Road, at the more fashionable end, for which Mr. Crichton had himself invented the sign (in memory of his past experiences) of “The Case is Altered.” Mr. Crichton, too, was altered and yet the same. He wore one of the Earl’s old smoking-jackets, with a coronet still embroidered on the breast pocket—not, he said, out of anything so vulgar as ostentation, but as a sort of last link with the Upper House—but his patent leather boots had given place to carpet slippers, and his trousers, once so impeccable, were now baggy at the knees. Altogether he was an easier, more relaxed Crichton, freed as he was from the restraining, if respectful, criticism of the servants’ hall. Indeed, Miss Fisher, who had always hated him, hinted that he had become slightly Rabelaisian—a reference which she owed to mademoiselle—though she would not have dared to repeat the hint to Mrs. Crichton (née Tweeny). For marriage had in no degree abated Tweeny’s reverence for her Crichton, or rather, as old habit still impelled her to call him, her Guv.</p>
<p>The Guv. was at this moment comforting himself with a glass of port (from the wood) and thinking of that bin of ’47 he had helped the Earl to finish in past days. And now he was inhabiting a road where (at least at the other, the unfashionable, end) port was invariably “port wine.” Such are the vicissitudes of human affairs. Tweeny herself was guilty of the solecism, as was perhaps to be expected from a lady who, for her own drinking, preferred swipes. Though she had made great strides in her education under the Guv.’s guidance (she was now nearly into quadratic equations, and could say the dates of accession of the kings of England down to James II.), she still made sad havoc of her nominatives and verbs in the heat of conversation.</p>
<p>“A gent as wants to see the Guv.,” said the potboy, popping his head in at the bar-parlour door—the potboy, for Tweeny knew better than to have a barmaid about the place for the Guv. to cast a favourable eye on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A not very clean card was handed in, inscribed:—</p>
<p align="center">
  <span class="smcap">“Mr. Littimer,”</span>
</p>
<p>and the owner walked in after it. Or, rather, glided softly in, shutting the door after entry as delicately as though the inmates had just fallen into a sweet sleep on which their life depended. Mr. Littimer was an old-fashioned looking man, with mutton-chop whiskers, a “stock,” tied in a large bow, a long frock-coat, and tight trousers—the whole suggesting nothing of recent or even[53] modern date, but, say, 1850. It was an appearance of intense respectability, of super-respectability, of that 1850 respectability which was so infinitely more respectable than any respectability of our own day. Mr. Crichton stared, as well he might, and washed his hands with invisible soap. Though, in fact, now middle-aged, he felt in this man’s presence extremely young. He clean forgot that he had been a King in Babylon. Indeed, for the first time in his life he, the consummate, the magisterial, the admirable Crichton, felt almost green</p>
<p>“Mr. Crichton, sir,” said the visitor, with an apologetic inclination of the head, “I have ventured to take the great liberty of calling upon you, if you please, sir, and,” he added with another inclination of the head to Mrs. Crichton (who felt what she would herself have called flabbergasted), “if you please, ma’am, as an old friend of your worthy father. He was butler at Mrs. Steerforth’s when I valeted poor Mr. James.” His eye fell, respectably, on Mr. Crichton’s port. “Ah!” he said, “his wine was Madeira, but——” A second glass of port was thereupon placed on the table, and he sipped it respectably.</p>
<p>Mr. Crichton could only stare, speechless. All his aplomb had gone. He gazed at a ship’s bucket, his most cherished island relic, which hung from the ceiling (as a shade for the electric light—one of his little mechanical ingenuities), and wondered whether he ever could have put anybody’s head in it. His[54] philosophy was, for once, at fault. He knew, none better, that “nature” had made us all unequal, dividing us up into earls and butlers and tweenies, but now for the first time it dawned upon him that “nature” had made us unequally respectable. Here was something more respectable, vastly more respectable, than himself; respectable not in the grand but in the sublime manner.</p>
<p>He could not guess his visitor’s thoughts, and it was well for his peace of mind that he could not. For Mr. Littimer’s thoughts were, respectably, paternal. He thought of Mr. Crichton, sen., and still more of the senior Mrs. Crichton, once “own woman” to Mrs. Steerforth. Ah! those old days and those old loves! How sad and bad and mad it was—for Mr. Littimer’s poet was Browning, as his host’s was Henley, as suited the difference in their dates—and how they had deceived old Crichton between them! So this was his boy, his, Littimer’s, though no one knew it save himself and the dead woman! And as he gazed, with respectable fondness, at this image, modernized, modified, subdued, of his own respectability, he reflected that there was something in heredity, after all. And he smiled, respectably, as he remembered his boy’s opinion that the union of butler and lady’s maid was perhaps the happiest of all combinations. Perhaps, yes; but without any perhaps, if the combination included the valet.</p>
<p>Unhappy, on the other hand, were those combinations[55] from which valets were pointedly excluded. There was that outrageous young person whom Mr. James left behind at Naples and who turned upon him, the respectable Littimer, like a fury, when he was prepared to overlook her past in honourable marriage.</p>
<p>His meditations were interrupted by Mrs. Crichton, who had been mentally piecing together her recollections of “David Copperfield”—her Guv. had given her a Dickens course—and had now arrived at a conclusion. “Axin’ yer pardon, mister,” she said (being still, as we have stated, a little vulgar when excited), “but if you was valet to Mr. James Steerforth, you’re the man as ’elped ’im to ruin that pore gal, and as afterwards went to quod for stealin’. I blushes”—here her eye fell on the Guv., who quietly dropped the correction “blush”—“I blush for yer, Mr. Littimer.” “Ah, ma’am,” Mr. Littimer respectably apologized, “I attribute my past follies entirely to having lived a thoughtless life in the service of young men; and to having allowed myself to be led by them into weaknesses, which I had not the strength to resist.”</p>
<p>“And that, I venture to suggest, ma’am,” he respectably continued, “is why your worthy husband has been so much more fortunate in the world than myself. We are both respectable, if I may say so, patterns of respectability” (Crichton coloured with gratification at this compliment from the Master), “and yet our respectability has brought us very[56] different fates. And why, if you please, ma’am? Because I have served the young, while he has served the old—for I believe, ma’am, the most noble the Earl of Loam is long past the meridian. Besides, ma’am, we Early Victorians had not your husband’s educational advantages. There were no Board schools for me. Not that I’m complaining, ma’am. We could still teach the young ’uns a thing or two about respectability.” And so with a proud humility (and an intuition that there was to be no more port) he took his leave, again shutting the door with the utmost delicacy. He was, in truth, well content. He had seen his boy. The sacred lamp of respectability was not out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Mr. Crichton sat in a maze, still washing his hands with invisible soap.

<h2 align="center">THE BUSINESS MAN</h2>
<p>It is not easy for the slave of “copy,” sedentary and shy, to know that triumphant figure of the active, bustling world, the business man. The business man is too busy, and can only be seen in office hours, when the scribe is correcting proofs or, perhaps, not yet up. Nevertheless, I once nearly saw the Governor of the Bank of England. I hold the Governor to be the archetype of the business man. In my green unknowing youth I used to take the gentleman in cocked hat and picturesque robe at the Threadneedle Street entrance for the Governor, but now know better. Well, I once nearly saw the Governor. It was on the stage. Mr. Gerald du Maurier was in the bank-parlour when a servant entered and said: “The Governor of the Bank of England to call on you, sir.” “Show him in,” said Mr. du Maurier with the easy nonchalance of which only actors have the secret. It was a tremendous moment. I seemed to hear harps in the air. And just then, down came the curtain! It was felt, no doubt, that the Governor of the Bank of England ought not to be made a motley to the view. But I was inconsolable. I had been robbed of my one chance of seeing the supreme business man.</p>
<p>Of late, however, the veil that shrouds the business man from the non-business eye has been partly lifted. The pictorial advertisement people have got hold of him and give brief, tantalizing glimpses of his daily life. Maeterlinck speaks of “l’auguste vie quotidienne” of Hamlet. That only shows that Hamlet (it is indeed his prime characteristic) was not a business man. For the business man’s daily life, if the advertisements are to be trusted, is not so much august as alert, strenuous, and, above all, devoted to the pleasures of the toilet. And his toilet seems, for the most part, to centre in or near his chin. Indeed, it is by his chin that you identify the business man. You know what Pascal said of Cleopatra’s nose: how, if it had been an inch shorter, the whole history of the world would have been different. Much the same thing may be said about the business man’s chin. Had it been receding or pointed or dimpled or double, there would have been no business man and consequently no business. But things, as Bishop Butler said, are what they are and their consequences will be what they will be. The business man’s chin is prominent, square, firm, and (unless he deals in rubber tires—the sole exception to the rule) smooth. It is as smooth as Spedding’s forehead, celebrated by Thackeray and Edward Fitzgerald. It is, indeed, like that forehead, a kind of landmark, a public monument. Even the rich, velvety lather, which does not dry on the face and leaves behind a feeling of complete comfort and well-grooming, cannot disguise[298] it. No wonder the business man is so particular about shaving it! It is a kind of religious rite, an Early Matins, with him.</p>
<p>Outside the bank-parlour, the mart and the exchange the business man takes no risks, and at his toilet-table he prefers safety razors. Indeed, he collects them. Sometimes he favours the sort that can be stropped in a moment with one turn of the wrist; sometimes the sort that needs no stropping at all. But, like all collectors, he is never so happy as when handling, or rather caressing the objects of his collection. Mark how his eyes dance with delight and his smile sweetens as the razor courses over his chin. Evidently life at this moment is burning for him with a hard gem-like flame. Call it not shaving! Say, rather, he is ministering to the symbolic element in him, daintily smoothing the proud emblem of his power—to which he will add the finishing touch of pearl-powder, whose constant use produces a delicate bloom, tones up the complexion, and protects the skin against the ravages of time.</p>
<p>When the chin has been prepared for the business day he tries and contrasts the several effects of it over a variety of collars. For the business man collects collars, too. His chin protrudes with quiet but firm insistence over some of them, nestles coyly in others, or it may be emerges with ease from the sort designed to give ample throat room and especially favoured by men who seek considerable freedom but at the same time a collar of character and distinction.[299] Nor has he any false shame about being seen in his shirt-sleeves. In fact, he seems to be in the habit, when half-dressed, of calling in his friends (evidently, from their chins, fellow business men) to see how perfectly his shirt fits at the neck and how its thoroughly shrunk material is none the worse for repeated visits to the laundry.</p>
<p>Once dressed—and I pass over his interviews with his tailor (he collects overcoats), because that would lead us far and might land us, unawares, among sportsmen, or airmen, or other non-business men—once dressed, he is to be seen at his office. That does not mean that he is to be seen at work. No, it is a somewhat sinister fact that the advertisements hardly ever show the business man engaged in business. You may find him at an enormous desk bristling with patent devices and honeycombed with pigeon-holes, where he sees himself invested with perfect control and rid of all petty routine anomalies, with a mind free to consider questions of policy and the higher aspirations of his house. But not, in blunt English, working, oh dear no! He is pleasantly gossiping with another business man, who is lolling over the edge of the desk smoking a cigarette. Now and then, it is true, you may get a glimpse of him at the telephone. But then his tender smile gives him away. It is obviously no business conversation but an appointment for lunch with his <i>fiancée</i>.</p>
<p>Only one advertisement artist has ever “spotted”[300] him at work. He was addressing the board. The board all wore white waistcoats, the same business chin, and the same dry smile as the orator, who with clenched fist and flashing eye assured them of his conviction that increased production results from the bond of mutual goodwill created between employer and employee by the board’s system of life assurance. Altogether, a very jolly party. But outside the world of business men it wouldn’t be considered work. Really, for work it looks as though you would have to go to the non-business man. Think of Balzac’s eighteen hours a day!</p>
<p>But the business man, I daresay, will reply, as they said to the sonneteer in Molière, that “Le temps ne fait rien à l’affaire.” Certainly, the business man’s time doesn’t—for you next find him, in spick and span evening dress, at the dinner-table, beaming at the waiter who has brought him his favourite sauce. The business man collects sauces, but prefers the sauce that goes with everything. After dinner you may see him, before a roaring fire, holding up his glass of port to the light and telling another business man who the shipper is. Last scene of all, a night-piece, you have a glimpse of him in his pyjamas merrily discoursing with several other business men (in different patterns of the same unshrinkable fabric) all sitting cross-legged and smoking enormous cigars. This is the end of a perfect business day. And you conclude that business men sleep in dormitories.</p>
